First make sure mic is on through geforce menu, then go to audio settings in game and match with my settings, you can test your mic in the game if you press start test and you'll hear your voice back. For graphics this is what I find works best, you may want to use frame gen if you have a g-sync or variable refresh rate monitor, I don't so I keep it off and these settings get me 120fps almost locked.
